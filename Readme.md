# Inertia Toolhead

The Inertia Toolhead is a minimally modular toolhead that aims to meet compatibility needs while minimizing part complexity and total parts and hardware.

The aim is to provide a supremely rigid toolhead for both Monolith and Traditional belt pathing that is easy to print, assemble, and fits a wide variety of hotends, and in the near future, extruder designs.

#### Current Carriage Support:
- MGN12H in both Small, Large, and Mega Hotend setups with pathing for both Monolith and Traditional belting
- MGN9H in Traditional belt pathing for Small Hotends

#### Current Hotend Support
- Rapido HF (Small)
- Rapido UHF (Large)
- Dragon ACE/ACE Volcano HF (Small)
- Dragon ACE/ACE Volcano UHF (Large)
- ReVolcano (Small)
- Revo Voron (Small)
- Heatcore 4 (Small)
- Goliath/CHC XL (Large)
- Goliath/CHC XL + MZE (Mega)

**Development is ongoing and we are open to requests for future hotend/carriage support.**
